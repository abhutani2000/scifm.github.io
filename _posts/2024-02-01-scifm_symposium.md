For the first time ever, the [2024 MICDE Symposium](https://micde.umi ch.edu/news-events/annual-symposia/2024-symposium/) will focus on Scientific Foundation Models  that aim to have a similar transformative impact on science as Generative AI has had on natural language.
The Symposium will bring together the world's leaders to share their perspective and lead workshops on this exciting and nascent field.

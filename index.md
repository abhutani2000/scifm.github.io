Scientific Foundations Models - an initiative in the Michigan Institute for Computational Discovery and Engineering (MICDE) at the University of Michigan, launched in partnership with Deep Forest Sciences - aims to leverage large amounts of unlabelled data available in scientific domains to develop scientific foundation models enabling Generative AI for materials design and towards autonomous scientific discovery agents.

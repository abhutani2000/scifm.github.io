    MICDE recently organized the [SciFM conference](https://micde.umich.edu/event/conference-symposiumscifm24-conference-2/) and had an incredible reception for the event.  
    Based on the feedback from that meeting and further discussions with National Lab and academic partners, 
    we are excited to organize the SciFM Summer School from July 8 to July 26. 
    We wish for this to be a recurring event hosted at different locations across the country. 
    The first instance is going to be run in parallel at the University of Michigan (UM) and at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). 
    The focus will be on developing technical plans for specific instances for SciFMs; 
    a hackathon to jumpstart the construction of SciFMs; 
    as an incubator for ideas; a training ground for researchers and students; 
    and to further a vision for a national SciFM ecosystem.

    If you are interested in joining us for the summer school, 
    please contact the organizers, Venkat Viswanathan and Karthik Duraisamy, (micde-contact@umich.edu) 
    indicating your thrust preference and experience.

    Participants will explore innovative applications of Foundation Model in four application domains\:
  list:
    - name: Materials
      description: >
        Foundation Models for material science have been used for a range of material property prediction, 
        retrosysnthesis and structure search tasks.
    - name: Biology
      description: >
        In Biology, Foundation Models have enable numerous breakthroughs including protein structure prediction 
        and the classfication of emergent variants of viruses.
    - name: Computation Science
      description: >
        A computation science Foundation Model capable of designing and orchestrating computational research 
        campaigns will enable scientists to focus on domain science through the creative specification of hypotheses 
        and greatly accelerate scientific discovery.
    - name: Partial Differential Equations
      description: The Foundation Models may be the route to enabling data efficient, general purpose PDE solvers.

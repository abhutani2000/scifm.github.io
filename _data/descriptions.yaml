    MICDE recently organized the [SciFM conference](https://micde.umich.edu/event/conference-symposiumscifm24-conference-2/) and had an incredible reception for the event.  
    Based on the feedback from that meeting and further discussions with National Lab and academic partners, 
    we are excited to organize the SciFM Summer School from July 8 to July 26. 
    We wish for this to be a recurring event hosted at different locations across the country. 
    The first instance is going to be run in parallel at the University of Michigan (UM) and at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). 
    The focus will be on developing technical plans for specific instances for SciFMs; 
    a hackathon to jumpstart the construction of SciFMs; 
    as an incubator for ideas; a training ground for researchers and students; 
    and to further a vision for a national SciFM ecosystem.
